A simple weather app that shows the temperature, wind speed, humidity in Dubai city

1. Create a widget that shows the date of today and the two days after it.

2. When pressing on the date, another screen appear and show the temperature, wind
speed, humidity.

3. The screen that shows the date of today and the two
days after and the second should look similar to the attached image.

4. Using API (detailed below) to fetch data and parse the response into a module
before presenting it.

5. Using http://openweathermap.com to get the response data.

7. If the request fails an error will appear.

8. When the response arrives, it will be saved in the memory for one day.

9. If the user requests the same day twice, the app will check for saved data instead of calling
the API.
